short-description: An algorithm for finding the least-cost path from an origin to a destination.  In dynamic models, a time-dependent shortest path algorithm is used, which accounts for variation in costs and available links minute-to-minute or second-to-second rather than assuming a static cost and availability over a lengthier time period.
