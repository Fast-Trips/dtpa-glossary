title: stop state initialization
short-description: The first step of a shortest-path algorithm.  Stop labels should be initialized to be greater-than or equal to their final cost and should allow for the greatest number of emanating links (i.e. for a walk access link in a forward-shortest-path, assume it is as early as possible).  All stops are added to the label stop queue.
