short-description: Concept that a traveler will board a vehicle with a longer expected travel time to the destination if the vehicle arrives first and the expected time conditional upon the arrival of the vehicle is less than the expected time of travel on an ostensibly faster route for which the passenger must wait to board (Chiriqui and Robillard, 1975).
