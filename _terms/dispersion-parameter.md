title: dispersion parameter
short-description: Used for modeling stochasticity.  This parameter is between 0 and 1.  Higher values for the parameter mean that higher cost links within a hyperlink are devalued compared to the lowest cost links in the hyperlink.  That is, if the lowest cost for a hyperlink is c, when a new link gets added to the hyperlink with a cost higher than c, when Œ∏ is closer to 1, the more the new link has a low probability compared to the lowest cost link.  The higher Œ∏ emphasizes the lowest cost link more.
