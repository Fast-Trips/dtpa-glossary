title: path overlap variable
short-description: An additive measure of similarity between paths.  In road-based path-choice models, this is often the distance of the shared links.  In passenger-based path-choice models, this could include considerations for shared-routes, similar-routes, on/off stations, traversed stations, traverse distance and more.  If the overlap variable is an indicator variable (ùõø), then it can be 1 or 0; if it distance or cost, then it is a continuous variable.
notation:   la is the path overlap variable for link a; Li is the sum of the path overlap variable over all legs that make up path alternative i.
