title: observed passenger path
short-description: A path, with waypoints, timing and costs, that the passenger was observed taking.  Often gained from an on-board survey or GPS data.  Full observed paths with all applicable waypoints can be difficult to obtain and verify the validity of.  For example, on-board surveys often use a combination of stated, revealed, and intended paths because passengers are often intercepted mid-trip.  GPS data often has complete revealed data, but can be subject to GPS errors, which are most drastic in urban environments. Therefore, observed passenger paths often have a great deal of interpolation and assumptions built into them that are important to understand when using them to evaluate a model.
