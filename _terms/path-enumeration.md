title: path enumeration
short-description: Walk the labeled hyperpath and generate all of the actual, realizable paths from it.  At this point, we can fix the timing of the walk links and therefore have actual wait times.  The path costs here are used to calculate the probability of each of these paths.  The output of this process is a pathset.
