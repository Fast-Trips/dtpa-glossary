title: simulated probability
short-description: The probability of each path as calculated during simulation.  Like the simulated cost, it differs from the pathfinding probability in that it includes the effect of simulation (loaded vehicles and updated vehicle travel times, crowding costs or costs associated from being bumped from the vehicle, which may make the path infeasible, giving it 0% probability).
