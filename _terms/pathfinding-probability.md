title: pathfinding probability
short-description: The probability of each path in the pathset based on the pathfinding cost.  Differs from simulated probability in that the simulation step hasn’t occurred yet so the probabilities are subject to change; for example, some paths may become infeasible if the simulation fills up some vehicles so the the passenger cannot board the vehicle for this leg.  May also include path overlap penalties (although Fast-Trips doesn’t calculate it in Pathfinding, only in Simulation).
