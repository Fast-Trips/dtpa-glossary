title: stop label
short-description: In the context of a shortest path algorithm, stops are labeled with the overall generalized cost of travelling from that stop to the destination (in a forward shortest-path) or from that stop to the origin (in a backwards shortest-path). Stops can be iteratively updated throughout the algorithm.
