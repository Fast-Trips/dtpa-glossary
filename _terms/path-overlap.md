title: path overlap
short-description: In a set of possible paths through a transportation network, some portion of each of the paths may share a facility meaning that each choice in a choice set is not mutually exclusive.  This is important in the context of choice modeling, since it violates the “Independence” in the IIA property of a Multinomial Logit. Formulations that compensate for this violation by discounting the “independence” of each path based on a measurement of commonality (the path overlap variable) include the path-size logit model.
