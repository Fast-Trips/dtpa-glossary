title: link feature
short-description: A feature that can be accurately represented for an individual link (e.g. in-vehicle-time, wait-time, walk-time).  Some features, like fares, can be represented at a link level, but may not be accurate if used without understanding of the entire path due to dependent features such as maximum fares or transfers.
